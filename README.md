# Weighted Grade Calculator
## What does it do?
This program discounts the weight of grades as the number of wrong answers increases.

## What is it for? 
This grading program is useful for grading tests that have a "snowball" effect â€” where getting one answer wrong makes it more likely to get further answers wrong. This grading scale also helps to give weight to good faith efforts and prevents tanking a students grade, as the lowest possible score typically occurs at 45%.

## How was it made? 
The program is written in C and makes use of the cs50 library from Harvard's CS50 course.
