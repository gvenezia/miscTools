/*  This program discounts the weight of grades as the number
*   of wrong answers increases. This program is useful for grading tests that have a "snowball" effect â€” where
*   getting one answer wrong makes it more likely to get further answers wrong. This grading scale also
*   helps to give weight to good faith efforts and prevents tanking a students grade, as the lowest possible
*   score typically occurs at 45.
*
*   The #wrong is printed in the first column, then the regular unweighted score, then the weighted score is printed.
*   The values can then be exported into an excel sheet for quick reference or use in the "find-replace" function.
